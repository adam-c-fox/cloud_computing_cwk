## 70+ notes

Time taken to iterate over whole execution space (pre-throttling): ~320 mins

Time take to launch instance of AMI...

- Mode: 31 secs
- Mean: 42.57 secs

^ Small enough fractions of execution space to ignore



### Example execution

Run within 60 mins, with 80% confidence level...

​	Number of machines = 320/60 = 5.33333 = 6

​	Adjusted for confidence level = 6 * 0.8 = 4.8 = **5**



Therefore, **5** machines are launched...
